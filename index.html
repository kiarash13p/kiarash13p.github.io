    <p>Hi, This is Kiarash, an Educational Assistant at Resource Engineering section in Geoscience & Engineering Department, Delft University of Technology. 
    Prior to this, I was Process Specialist, 
    Project Coordinator, and R&D expert at Faratahghigh-E-Sepahan (SBR). Sounds complicated but for me, graduated as a mining engineer was merely
    a door to broad my horizon about the mining industry and numerous gaps within the academia environment.<br>
    <br>My duty is mainly comprised of teaching courses, educating students, and evaluating their progress among their activities. Moreover, I am going to 
    pursue my academic and industrial interests by creating and following new research proposals for master and PhD students.
    I envisioned a future of educational excellences where graduate people will understand the complexity of market, industry, supply and demand and will be
    able to secure and manage mining activities, from exploration and prospecting to utilizing and production, safe and sustainable by integrating mathematics,
    physics, geology, and economy.
    <br><br>
    Such vision is also applicable to myself, as I am going to grow and experience new things on this environment. This progress cannot be attained but with
    proper collaboration followed by both sides, industry and academia, and that's why I am here at academia again :D.
    If youâ€™d like to connect, do not hesitate send me a message for further discussion.</p>
