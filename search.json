    "text": "“Numbers never lie!”\nKiarash Pashna\n\nThis is Kiarash, Teacher at Geoscience & Engineering Department, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.\nWith a robust foundation in Mining Engineering, his journey has led him to TU Delft, where he currently empowers students in their projects and courses. His previous tenure honed his skills in data analysis, applied Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence, particularly within the context of ferrous metals exploration, Iron ore Pelletization, and refining bentonites.\nHe has been engaged in many research and teaching activities, one of which is to reduce the uncertainties lie on the consequences of decisions about Raw Materials. He would like to make scenarios that support decision makers by forecsting how the supply chains respond to mining factors, market dynamics, and human interventions.\nKiarash is passionate about the intersection of academia and industry, and he is eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals. He is open to new opportunities and is always ready to engage in meaningful discussions. If you would like to connect, please feel free to reach out to him. At this page, you will find his active profiles to contact with.\n\nWhat am I looking for?\n\nTeaching and Democratizing AI: Artificial Intelligence carries a significant share of human activities in the contemporary world, and modern societies must teach and communicate its principles clearly to new generations in order to sustain the chain of innovation and technological advancement. Therefore, one of my interests is to combine my own expertise with that of other professionals to promote the sustainable education and development of AI.\nImprove my thinking and interpesonal skills: From my perspective, every question contains half of its answer. However, people often focus solely on obtaining results without adequately reflecting on the nature and intent of the question itself. My main interest lies in facilitating the development of robust and sustainable ways of thinking—approaches that encourage individuals and groups to engage critically with questions and contribute to innovative solutions for future generations. I believe this is not only valuable but essential in a world increasingly defined by unforeseen and complex challenges. I would like to be engaged in activities in which I can positively teach and learn my knowledge and expertises.\nCritical Raw Materials Value Chain: Modern economies depend on a vast range of raw materials — from iron and limestone to gold and semiconductors. While many raw materials have long been traded through established and organized markets, critical ones such as lithium have yet to benefit from comparable systems. My main interest is to leverage my wisdom and expertise in enlightening CRM Value Chain bottlenecks.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n Back to top"
